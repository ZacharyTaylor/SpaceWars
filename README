====================        SpaceWars game        ==============================
====================        kjb146 & zjt14        ==============================

SpaceWars is based off the original spacewar game with several key differences
-There are multiple galaxies that can be hyperspaced between
-Each galaxy has up to 4 suns of random size and location
-The game is networked with no limit on the number of maximum players


====================         HOW TO BUILD         ==============================

Easiest: use the NetBeans Project associated with this project

Next Easiest:
bring a terminal to the "Client" directory, and build using ant.
Targets accepted include: "", "compile", "run", "javadoc", "clean"

after the project has built, run the following command from the "SpaceWars"
directory

java -Djava.library.path=./lib/lwjgl/native -jar ./dist/SpaceWars.jar

The directory is important to maintain internal relative references.


====================    The Spacewars Launcher    ==============================

When first started the launcher is displayed from here the user can create a
server or join an existing one

To join an existing server wait until it is created then hit update server list
The server should now be displayed in the available servers pane
To join it select it and hit connect or double click it

To create a new server hit start new server type in a name and hit OK. the
server should be created and should be able to be joined as outlined above.
To stop the server hit the stop server button.

Once connected a new window should appear displaying the current galaxy and
your ship


====================            The HUD           ==============================

Your stats are displayed in the bottom left
Shield strength is shown in green
Fuel in orange (1 bar = 40 fuel)
Missiles in white


====================           Controls           ==============================

Fire =  space bar
Left = left arrow
Right = right arrow
Accelerate = up arrow
Hyperspace = m
Respawn = enter


====================           The Game           ==============================

Your objective is to avoid stars, missiles, enemies and debris while shooting
missiles to destroy your opponents. The ships can take 5 hits before being
destroyed and on destruction they become debris that can take a further 5 hits. 

All enemies appear as one type of spacecraft and you as another.
Each ship has a limited number of missiles, fuel and shields

Shield strength is lost where your ship comes in contact with something 
(including your own missiles). The ship starts with 5 shields. Your shield
strength and the enemy's can be seen from the colour (color -sic) of the shields 

 5 = white
 4 = blue
 3 = green
 2 = yellow
 1 = red

Fuel is used to turn, accelerate and hyperspace. The ships start with 2000
	turning uses 1 fuel
	accelerating uses 10 fuel
	hyperspace uses 100 fuel
	
Missiles are used when you fire them. The ship starts with 50 and can fire 5
a second


====================       Hyperspace rules       ==============================

When first spawned a player will be in their own galaxy

On hyperspace a random galaxy that is not the one you came from is selected. 
If there is less than 4 other players you are placed in it. If it has more 
then this or there is only one galaxy a new one is created and you enter this 
galaxy If the one you left is now empty of players it is removed

hyperspacing has a 1 second cool-down between uses

in hyperspacing you maintain your speed and heading but your position changes.
You will never collide with a mass on exiting hyperspace but you may be very
close to and heading towards one. This is the
risk of hyperspacing

When respawning the player has a new ship hyperspaced in
